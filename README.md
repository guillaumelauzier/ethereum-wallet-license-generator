# ethereum-wallet-license-generator

This contract allows users to generate a license file based on their Ethereum wallet address. When a user calls the generateLicense function, the contract checks if the user has already agreed to the license. If the user has not agreed to the license, the function generates a license file in the form of a string and returns it to the user. The license file includes the name of the license, the project name, the current year, and the license text.

The hasAgreed mapping is used to keep track of whether a user has agreed to the license. When a user generates a license, their address is added to the mapping to indicate that they have agreed to the license.

This is just a basic example, and there are many additional features and functionalities that can be added to a license generator contract. It's important to keep in mind that creating a license generator involves many other considerations beyond the code itself, including legal, regulatory, and operational aspects.
